# ANTextFX
Combination of [ANTLR](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4) with [RichTextFX](https://github.com/TomasMikula/RichTextFX) for easy simple IDE-like text fields.

ANTextFX (a portmanteu of ANTLR & Rich-Text FX) is a library that allows for grammar-based syntax highlighting, like the highlighting provided in most modern IDE's. ANTextFX can be combined with existing ANTLR grammars and a small style sheet to provide text components that look much like IntelliJ's or Visual Studio's syntax highlighter.

## Getting started ##

ANTextFX is designed to be used from either Java or FXML:

**FXML**:

_TBD: FXML Source code_

or, from **Java**:

_TBD: Java source code_

and the text to highlight

>_TBD: highlighted text_

The result is:

_TBD: Screenshots_
